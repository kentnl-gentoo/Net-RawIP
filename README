This is Net::RawIP, a perl module can to manipulate raw IP packets,
with an optional feature for manipulating Ethernet headers.

NOTE: Ethernet related methods currently implemented only on Linux!
Help with port eth.c to other platforms is very apprecated.

This is beta release.

I test the module only on Linux 2.0.3x with glibc and FreeBSD 2.2.8.

You need perl 5.004 or later to use this module.
You need to have installed libpcap, available from

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z

You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There are also some example scripts.

Please report any bugs/suggestions to Sergey Kolychev <ksv@al.lg.ua>
